# Leetcode & DSA Practice

Welcome to the **Leetcode & DSA Practice** repository! 🚀

This repo serves as a personal collection of coding challenges, solutions, and notes focusing on **Leetcode problems** and **core Data Structure & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts. It is intended to document progress, learnings, and provide code samples for interview preparation and algorithmic skills improvement.

## Contents

- 📝 Solutions to Leetcode problems in various languages
- ⚡ DSA implementation (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, etc.)
- 💡 Problem-solving approaches, hints, and best practices
- 📓 Notes and explanations for common patterns and techniques
- 📓 Requred open-jdk 24. Intellij IDEA

## Structure

Your file organization might look like this:
```
/
├── arrays/
├── linked-lists/
├── trees/
├── recursion/
├── dynamic-programming/
├── sorting-searching/
